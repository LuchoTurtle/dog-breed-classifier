# Dog Breed Classifier
This is the second project of the Udacity Deep Learning nanodegree, part of my voyage to have a grasp of what the hell is going on with Deep Learning and Machine Learning in general :smile:.

In this notebook, I'm attempting to predict a dog breed based on an image by creating a CNN, both from scratch and from a pre-trained model (in this case, I'm using the ResNet50 one) and comparing results.  It is implemented using PyTorch.

This project is particularly interesting because it encompasses much of the pipeline of training a model, from data augmentation to data visualization and hyper parameter tweaking.
